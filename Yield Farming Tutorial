How Yield Farming Works

Yield farming is a strategy in DeFi that allows users to earn rewards by providing liquidity to protocols.

Steps to Yield Farm:
1. Choose a protocol (e.g., Uniswap, FIVA)
2. Provide liquidity to a pool (e.g., TON-USDT)
3. Earn rewards from transaction fees or token incentives
