# How to Write for DeFi Protocols

DeFi can be complex, but great documentation makes it accessible. Here’s my approach:

## 1. Know the Audience
Some readers are crypto-native; others are brand new. Write for both.

## 2. Use Analogies
- AMMs = “digital vending machines”
- LPs = “earning rent for lending out tokens”

## 3. Structure Matters
- Start with the why
- Explain the what
- Then show the how

Good DeFi docs reduce confusion, increase trust, and improve adoption.
